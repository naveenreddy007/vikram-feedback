# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an interactive teacher review website for Vikram, an energetic engineering teacher who focuses on real-world practical applications. The website will collect student feedback to help him understand his teaching effectiveness and areas for improvement. The site will feature a modern, engaging UI with dark themes, glassmorphism effects, 3D elements, and smooth animations to create a "magical" experience that motivates students to provide thoughtful feedback.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to provide feedback on real-world application teaching so that I can express how well the teacher connects theory to practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student reaches the real-world feedback section THEN the system SHALL ask "Would you like me to explain real world things?"
2. WHEN a student responds THEN the system SHALL accept yes/no or scaled responses
3. WHEN a student provides additional comments THEN the system SHALL allow free-text input for elaboration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to suggest future topics so that I can influence what the teacher covers in upcoming sessions.
