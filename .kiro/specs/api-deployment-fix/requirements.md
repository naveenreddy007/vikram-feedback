# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The teacher review website form submission is not working after deployment to the cloud due to hardcoded localhost API URLs in the configuration. The system needs to dynamically configure API endpoints based on the deployment environment to ensure form submissions work correctly in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to submit feedback through the form on the deployed website, so that my feedback reaches the teacher successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student submits feedback on the production website THEN the system SHALL send the data to the correct production API endpoint
2. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to connect to localhost URLs in production
3. WHEN the API request is made THEN the system SHALL use the correct base URL for the current environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API configuration to automatically adapt to different deployment environments, so that I don't need to manually change URLs for each deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development THEN the system SHALL use localhost API endpoints
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the system SHALL use the production API endpoints
3. WHEN environment variables are properly set THEN the system SHALL prioritize those over hardcoded values
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to intelligent defaults based on the current domain

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and logging for API configuration issues, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix deployment problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API service initializes THEN the system SHALL log the detected environment and API base URL
2. WHEN an API request fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the attempted URL
3. WHEN environment detection fails THEN the system SHALL log warning messages with fallback behavior
4. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide additional debugging information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy-to-use tools for managing environment configurations, so that I can quickly update API URLs for different deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to a new environment THEN the developer SHALL be able to update the API URL with a single command
2. WHEN environment files are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between .env files and deployment configurations
3. WHEN using the environment update script THEN the system SHALL update both local environment files and deployment configuration files
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on how to set them up
